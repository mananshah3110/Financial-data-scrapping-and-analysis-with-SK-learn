# Financial-data-scrapping-and-analysis-with-SK-learn

The goal is to scrap historical data of stocks, commodities, indexes, mutual funds, ETFs, etc., and the stock fundamental data (such as balancesheets, dividends, etc.) from investing.com and moneycontrol.com (specific to Indian market) respectively. The scrpaed data is then cleaned and presented in an understanding way for further analysis. 

Scikit-learn is used to evaluate different forcasting ML algorithms. Once, it is done the next step would be to create an optimum portfolio encompasing not just stocks but above-mentioned investment options to diversify the investment.
